                <h2 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 5%;">Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
                    <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
                    <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
                    <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
                    <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
                    <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
                    <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 5%">Steps:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
                    <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</em></strong></li>
                </ol>
